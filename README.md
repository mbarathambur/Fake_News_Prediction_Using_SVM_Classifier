Project Overview:

This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to identify whether a given news article is real or fake. By analyzing textual data, the model learns patterns and features that help distinguish misleading information from authentic news. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future predictions.

Key Highlights:

->Text data preprocessing and cleaning

->Feature extraction using NLP techniques

->Implementation of a classification algorithm

->Model training and performance evaluation

->Trained model saved for reuse and deployment

->Practical application of machine learning in misinformation detection
